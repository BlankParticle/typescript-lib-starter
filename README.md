### 🎋 Adding new features

You need to first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#about-forking) this repository and then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork) it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/typescript-lib-starter
cd typescript-lib-starter
```

Now you need to create a new branch for your changes. For features, you may want to use `feat/[feature-name]` as the branch name.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/[feature-name]
```

Now you can make your changes. After you are done, you need to commit your changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ✨ My Awesome feature"
```

Now you need to push the changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin feat/[feature-name]
```

Now you need to create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) to the original repository. And you are done!

We will review your changes and merge them if everything looks good.
